this setup is inspired by gilles castel (https://castel.dev).

when i press super+s, rofi shows all my semesters. when i press super+c, rofi shows all of my courses in my currently selected semester.
when i press super+o, my current course is opened in a file manager, when i press super+p it opens in my terminal.
